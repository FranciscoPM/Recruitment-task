# Recruitment task from DEVnet
The task was about create a web app friendly and intuitive
that could generate graphical information stored on json files

# Starting the app
You just have to put it on your localhost without modify the 
repository structure. If you want to upload it as a web service
it would have the same work.

# Repostiroys and code
We have everything into our folder 'Recruitment-task'
If we open it we can see an index.html that is used to interact with the user and
it contains a list with the portfolios availables.

And 3 mores folders:
-> css: contains our css file
-> javascript: contains two files.js
* ajax.js: contains AJAX instructions to open and translate the json files to JSObjects
* functions.js: contains our JavaScript code to print our Objects
-> porftolio_data: contains the json files
